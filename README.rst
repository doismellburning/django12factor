What is it?
-----------

`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ is an awesome Python web
framework.

"`The Twelve-Factor App <https://12factor.net/>`__\ " is an awesome
methodology for building SaaS apps.

``django-12factor`` makes Django more 12factor-y. Right now, this
focuses on the `Config <https://12factor.net/config>`__ - "Store config
in the environment"; `Heroku <https://www.heroku.com/>`__ users with
addons will be particularly familiar with this.

Still not sure of the benefits? Check out
